              Title: Stained Memories

              [Verse 1]
              Walking down the street, feeling fine
              Until a splash of wine brings back a sign
              Of a love that was once so sweet
              But turned bitter, now memories repeat

              [Chorus]
              Stained memories, they won't fade away
              Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
              A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
              But now it's time to let it go

              [Verse 2]
              We started off so strong, love in bloom
              But slowly it all came crashing down, impending doom
              Words turned into weapons, hearts left scarred
              Now just a stain on my shirt, a reminder so hard

              [Chorus]
              Stained memories, they won't fade away
              Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
              A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
              But now it's time to let it go

              [Bridge]
              I try to wash away the stain
              But the memories still remain
              I'll learn to move on, find a new start
              And let go of the pain that's torn me apart

              [Chorus]
              Stained memories, they won't fade away
              Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
              A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
              But now it's time to let it go

              [Outro]
              I'll wear this stain as a badge of strength
              A reminder of what I've overcome at length
              I'll move forward, leaving the past behind
              Stained memories, but a new chapter in my mind."
