      [Verse 1]
      Walking down the street, feeling fine
      Until a splash of wine brings back a sign
      Of a love that was once so sweet
      But turned bitter, now memories repeat

      [Chorus]
      Stained memories, they won't fade away
      Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
      A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
      But now it's time to let it go

      [Verse 2]
      We started off so strong, love in bloom
      But slowly it all came crashing down, impending doom
      Words turned into weapons, hearts left scarred
      Now just a stain on my shirt, a reminder so hard

      [Chorus]
      Stained memories, they won't fade away
      Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
      A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
      But now it's time to let it go

      [Bridge]
      I try to wash away the stain
      But the memories still remain
      I'll learn to move on, find a new start
      And let go of the pain that's torn me apart

      [Chorus]
      Stained memories, they won't fade away
      Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
      A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
      But now it's time to let it go

      [Outro]
      I'll wear this stain as a badge of strength
      A reminder of what I've overcome at length
      I'll move forward, leaving the past behind
      Stained memories, but a new chapter in my mind."
